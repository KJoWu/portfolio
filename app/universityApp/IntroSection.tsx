        <div className="text-gray-700 ">
          <p>Imagine this: You've just purchased a flight with Flair Airlines from home, and the booking process was smooth. On the day of your flight, you're at the airport with your suitcase in one hand and your phone in the other. This is when the real challenge begins.

            "As you approach the check-in counter, anxiety builds. The app isn't working as you expected, so you remember your boarding pass is in your email. You open the email app, search for the pass, and hope your internet is stable. Or maybe you took a screenshot, but now youâ€™re frantically scrolling through your crowded photo gallery. Minutes tick by, and your stress rises. This is not the seamless travel experience you envisioned.
